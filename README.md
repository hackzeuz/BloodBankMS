## Project Overview

The **Blood Bank Management System** is designed to streamline the management of blood donor, recipient, and blood stock information. This system replaces the manual, paper-based record-keeping approach, providing an efficient and secure way for blood banks to manage their data digitally.

## Features

- **Admin Module**: Allows blood bank staff to securely log in and manage all operations, including adding, updating, and deleting records.
- **Donor Module**: Manages donor details like ID, name, blood group, and contact information.
- **Stock Module**: Keeps track of available blood stock, ensuring efficient management.
- **Recipient Module**: Allows for the recording and management of recipient details, including ID, blood group required, and contact information.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: Visual Basic
- **Backend**: Microsoft SQL Server

## Project Structure

- `Documentation/`: Contains the project documentation and source code.
- `Screenshots/`: Includes screenshots of the application to demonstrate functionality.

## Problem Statement

Traditional blood banks use a manual, paper-based system that is time-consuming, prone to errors, and lacks proper security measures. This project aims to automate the process by maintaining digital records of donors, recipients, and blood stock, reducing the burden of manual record-keeping.

## Objectives

- Manage donor, recipient, blood stock, and staff details.
- Reduce time consumption and improve accuracy.
- Keep records secure and easily verifiable.

## Benefits of the System

- **User-Friendly**: Simple interface for blood bank staff.
- **Increased Accuracy**: Minimizes errors in data entry.
- **Faster Operations**: Speeds up retrieval and updating of information.
- **Data Security**: Ensures that sensitive information is stored securely.

## Future Enhancements

- Transition to an online system where donors and recipients can register and check blood availability.
- Enable users to search for specific blood types by location.

## How to Run the Project

1. Install Microsoft SQL Server for database management.
2. Set up the frontend using Visual Basic.
3. Refer to the documentation for database schema and further details.
